    "Linear algebra is a form of mathematics, which is basis for many Machine Learning algorithms, especially Deep Learning algorithms. Good understanding of linear algebra is crucial for understanding and working in the field of the Machine and Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a relatively young field of study, formalized in the 1800s in order to find unknowns in systems of linear equations. Linear Algebra is applied in a science and engineering and it is essence of the areas in mathematics like geometry and functional analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is used in many domains like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs and Networks analysis \n",
