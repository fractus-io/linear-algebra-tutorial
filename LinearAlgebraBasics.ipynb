    "### Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra is a form of mathematics, which is basis for many Machine Learning algorithms, especially Deep Learning algorithms.\n",
    "Many computer scientists have little or no experience with it, even a good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working in the field of the Machine and Deep Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is a relatively young field of study, having initially been formalized in the 1800s in order\n",
    "to find unknowns in systems of linear equations. Linear Algebra is a continuous form of mathematics and is applied throughout science and engineering. Linear Algebra is also central to almost all areas of mathematics like geometry and functional analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore Linear Algebra is used in many domains like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Graphs and Networks analysis \n",
    "* Population growth analysis\n",
    "* Linear Programming, the simplex optimization method\n",
    "* Fourier Series, signal processing\n",
    "* Statistics and probability, least squares for regression\n",
    "* Computer Graphics, such as the translation, rescaling and rotation of images\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Algebra in Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Algebra is foundation for the Machine Learning. Datasets, images, one hot encodings, deep learning algortihms are based on the principles of the Linear Algebra. Let's see some common examples: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, it is common that model is build based on a dataset. Dataset is very often table with rows and columns, \n",
    "where each row represents an observation and column represents a feature of the observation. For example below is part of the\n",
    "dataset from bank which contains historical behavior of the customers(customer churn prediction):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "RowNumber,CustomerId,Surname,CreditScore,Geography,Gender,Age,Tenure,Balance,NumOfProducts,HasCrCard,IsActiveMember,EstimatedSalary,Exited\n",
    "1,15634602,Hargrave,619,France,Female,42,2,0,1,1,1,101348.88,1\n",
    "2,15647311,Hill,608,Spain,Female,41,1,83807.86,1,0,1,112542.58,0\n",
    "3,15619304,Onio,502,France,Female,42,8,159660.8,3,1,0,113931.57,1\n",
    "4,15701354,Boni,699,France,Female,39,1,0,2,0,0,93826.63,0\n",
    "5,15737888,Mitchell,850,Spain,Female,43,2,125510.82,1,1,1,79084.1,0\n",
    "6,15574012,Chu,645,Spain,Male,44,8,113755.78,2,1,0,149756.71,1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, dataset is an matrix, which is key data structure in Linear Algebra. Last column shows information did customer leaved the bank or not, and we extract last column in separated dataset, we will have vector which is another important data structure in Linear Algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Image consist of a set of the pixels. For a grayscale image each pixel is a scalar value from 0 to 255. Image has widht and height, so grayscale image is represented as matrix. \n",
    "Color images has one matrix per color(Red, Green, Blue), so here we are talking about tensor with 3 dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on the image, such as cropping, scaling, shearing and so on are all described using the notation and operations of\n",
    "linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see above, not all data in dataset is numerical, some values can be defined as text, check above columns Geography and Gender. Gender column can be encoded as Label Encoder in classes 0 or 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we apply same approach for Geography column, countries will be defined as 0, 1, 2 etc. This is not right approach, therefore in such a cases we can use One Hot Encoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear Reggression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is often used in machine learning for predicting numerical values in simpler\n",
    "regression problems. The most common way of solving linear regression is via a least squares\n",
    "optimization that is solved using matrix factorization methods from linear regression, such as\n",
    "an LU decomposition or an singular-value decomposition or SVD.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PCA, SVD, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recommendation systems\n",
    "\n",
    "If you go to popular web sites like Amazon or Netflix and if you search for some items, site will recommend simira item based on yours previous activitie. The development of Recommendation systems is primarily is based on linear algebra methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "A simple example is in the calculation of the similarity between sparse customer behavior vectors using distance measures such as Euclidean distance or dot products. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization methods like the singular-value decomposition are used widely in recommender systems to distill item and user data to their essence for querying and searching and comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Deep Learning Neural Networks, data is represented by linear equations, which are presented in the form of Linear Algebra objects like matrices and vectors. Algorithms which are used to train neural networks, consist of Linear Algreba operations, such as add, multiply, subtract, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear algebra provides the first steps into vectorisation, presenting a deeper way of thinking about parallelisation of certain operations. Algorithms written in standard 'for-loop' notation can be reformulated as matrix equations providing significant gains in computational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such methods are used in the major Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Pandas and Tensorflow. \n",
    "GPUs have been designed to carry out optimised linear algebra operations. The explosive growth in Deep Learning can partially be attributed to the highly parallelised nature of the \n",
    "underlying algorithms on commodity GPU hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fundamental objects of the Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental objects in Linear Algebra are \n",
    "* Scalars   \n",
    "* Vectors   \n",
    "* Matrices   \n",
    "* Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's dig deeper in fundamental Linear Algebra objects\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Scalars\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalar is a single number. Scalar is example of a 0th-order tensor.   \n",
    "Python built-in scalar types are int, float, complex, bytes, Unicode. \n",
    "In NumPy, there are 24 fundamental data types which are described in NumPy section.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can declare two variables of type int and float using standard Python notation and check with NumPy are those variables scalars or not:\n"
